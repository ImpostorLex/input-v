This note is part of on-going series of learning host evasion after successfully completing the TryHackMe module to supplement my knowledge: [[Windows Defense Evasion\|Windows Defense Evasion]].

## Windows API Basics
---
Creating a basic program to spawn `notepad.exe` using `CreateProcess` as attackers commonly used Windows API to for process injection, memory manipulation and more.

see source code here on github:

In order to use `CreateProcessA`, we need to follow based on the documentation:

After compiling and executing:

```cpp
g++ mycode.cpp -o myexe.exe
```

Then:

### Observing with Sysmon

Event IDs that we are interested in:

- **Event ID 1** - Process creation.
- **Event ID 10** - Process access.
- **Event ID 11** - File creation.

What about `CreateProcess` Windows API? unfotunately Sysmon is not built for that. Sysmon is designed for **forensic visibility and long-term monitoring**, not real-time API tracing. It focuses on key telemetry that aids incident detection and investigation.
### Process Monitor
---
In process monitor (for demonstration purposes) add the `createProces.exe` as filter and execute the binary again:

We can see that in just a simple program, it generated a lot of background noises, therefore the best case scenario is to go for low hanging fruits such as filtering for 'File', 'Registry', and processes with ParentId of our executable.
