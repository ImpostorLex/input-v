### Introduction
---
is one of Microsoft's old protocol family for authentication, this is done with a mechansim called _NetNTLM_ which allows authentication using a challenge-response-based scheme often used by services such as RDP, OWA, VPN or IIS web applications to authenticate a user against Active Directory without directly handling the user's password.

1. **Client → Service:** "Hi, I’m Alice, I want to log in."

2. **Service → Client:** "Prove it. Here’s a random number (the challenge)."

3. **Client → Service:** Takes the challenge, encrypts it using Alice’s password hash, sends back the result (the response).

4. **Service → Domain Controller (AD):** Forwards both challenge + response to the DC.

5. **DC → Service:** "Yes, that matches Alice’s password hash" (or "no, it doesn’t").

6. **Service → Client:** "Okay, you’re authenticated."

The service never learns Alice’s password — it just acts as a **middle-man**.
