### Introduction 
---
The language that had malware authors hooked due it's cross-platform support meaning you can compile to any specific OS you want with the same code base.
## Characteristics
---
- Compiling Go takes huge amount of disk space comparing to the actual lines of code.
- `.symtab` in strings output and make sure use like PE-bear tool and under 'Sections > .symtab'
- OSX or Linux samples with embedded URLs referencing 'Go.org' - `floss hi.exe -n <num> | grep go.org`
- Samples that import and use the HTTP library will have a user agent of `Go-http-client`
