### Introduction
---
The importance of maintaining data integrity and acquisation of _volatile_ data, are data that can be easily be lost, or altered, or overwritten during investigation.

- **Evidence**
	- A data or information that supports or denies an assumption (hypothesis)
- **Evidences Sources**
	- Features of devices that happens to tell a story. (logs)
## Data Gathering Prioritization

fourth:
- hard, solid state, drives
- System configurations
	- OS components.
	- Installed Software.
	- User files including metadata, configurations, and preferences.

fifth: (assuming the logs or information are send somewhere for redundancy.)
- endpoint telemetry.
- centralized log collection.

sixth: **archive media**
- backup tapes
- CDs, DVDs
- Archive hard drives via cloud based or not.
- Backups


**Organize and refine notes after each session including adding meta-tags**
