### Introduction
---
The goal is to have our systems and people ready to respond to incident or at best prevent them.
## Components
---
The important in all this is **documentation**: take it slow, it allows for critical thinking.
### End Users
---
- The users or employees directly interacting with our system, often times the weakest link in the security chain.
- **Solutions:**
	- Security awareness training.
	- Phishing simulations.
	- Incident reporting - it is not only the security analyst job, it is everyone's job.
### Stakeholder Involvement
---
- Information Technology.
- **Legal Advisors** - might need to consult if an incident revolves around our users including employee and customers.
- **Public Relations (PR)** - consult when and how to say it without triggering the end users.
### Communication
---
- Pre-established communication channels for incident reporting. **MAKE IT EASY!**
- Contact Information - maintain important contacts such as **who to escalate** and **who to consult with**?
- **Pre-estabslished 3rd party incident responders** assuming the company does not have enough resource to own a team.
- Out-of-band communications - ensure that there is alternative way to contact people, when dealing with APT ensure the security of communication such as telegram or signal.
### Physical Locations
---
- War room a place for tackling incidents or preparing against them. 
	- It can be virtual.
- Secure storage of evidence and other sensitive data.
	- Ensure the CIA triad and maintain [[cards/blue-team/digital-forensics/Chain of Custody\|Chain of Custody]].
### Incident Tracking
---
- It is important to track incident and take them down - one by one.
- thehive-project.org
- existing ticketing system
### Hardware and Software
---
- Digital forensics workstations
- Backup laptops
- Removable media for quick transfer of evidence or images.
- Evidence Documentation.
### Asset Management
---
- How can we protect it, if we are not aware of it's existence.
- **Solution:**
	- Document of OS, applications, hostnames, IPs.
	- Protocols, services.
	- Define **critical system** in business perspective.
	- Map of the computer network.
	- Baselines including clean OS images for restoration purposes.
	- Cryptographic hashes.
### Simulated Exercises
---
- A great way to prepare the incident response team or the overall organization, if it includes them.
	- Identify weaknesses.
### Incident Response Plan
---
- **Playbooks**
	- How to handle specific incidents.
- How and which to priotize incidents
