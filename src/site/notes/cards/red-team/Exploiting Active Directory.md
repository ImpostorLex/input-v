### Summary
---
**What you will find:** High-level overview of Kerberos authentication, ticket flow, delegation concepts, and common attack vectors.  

**Primary purpose:** [one short clause — what you will accomplish with this note].  

**Key Topics:** [[cards/active-directory/windows active directory\|Active Directory]], [[cards/red-team/Breaching Active Directory\|Breaching Active Directory]] and [[cards/red-team/Enumerating Active Directory (Authenticated Enumeration)\|Enumerating Active Directory (Authenticated Enumeration)]]

```C
If you have NO creds → Recon only
If you have USER creds → Enum → SPN → lateral
If you have LOCAL ADMIN on host → Coercion/Relay stage (your topic)
If you have SERVICE/HOST creds → Delegation / Kerberos attacks possible
If you touch DC with privilege → DA
```

**Expect to see:**  

- Key concepts: TGT/TGS lifecycle, AS-REP/AS-REQ, delegation types  
- Core techniques: AS-REP Roasting, Kerberoasting  
- Tools: Rubeus, Kekeo  
- Case notes / labs: THM Kerberoast Lab

#### Active Directory Exploitation

![Exploiting Active Directory-1.png|450](/img/user/cards/red-team/images/Exploiting%20Active%20Directory-1.png)

This is the part where you have performed internal recon and understand the lay of the land regarding the AD structure and environment, it's time for the exploitation phase.

You exploits misconfiguration to perform a combination of lateral movement and privilege escalation until you rich a suitable position to execute your goals. This phase is also combined with **persistence** so you can't lose access to your new position and additional **enumeration** as your new position might have additional information.
