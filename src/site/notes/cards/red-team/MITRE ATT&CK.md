### Introduction 
---
A framework to model the steps and details of a cyber attack taken by certain groups. It stands for Adversarial Tactics, Techniques and Common Knowledge.

_Why it is important for any cybersecurity personnel?_ It maps out the action needed for each stage of a cyber attack as well as it focuses on **techniques** used not the tools used by the attackers..

## Mapping CTI to ATT&CK
---
1. **Find the behavior --**  Look for what the adversary or software does, essentially, _what actions or activities are taking place_ and focus on the initial and post-compromise details.
2. **Research the behavior --**  Analysts may not be familiar with adversary behaviors. _Analysts gather information about the behavior they observed_
3. **Translate Behavior into a Tactic --**  Determine what tactics the adversary is trying to accomplish (for example, Initial Access, Credential Access etc.).
4. **Figure out what Technique Applies --** This is often the toughest part since not every behavior is necessarily a technique. (figure out the **specific technique**)
	- Try **keywords**.
	- Try **procedure**-level detail - these are the exact steps or methods the adversary uses
	- Try specific command strings.
