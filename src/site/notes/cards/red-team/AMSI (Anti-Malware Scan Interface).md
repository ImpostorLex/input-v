### Introduction
---
**AMSI (Anti-Malware Scan Interface)** is a **Windows security feature** that allows antivirus tools (like Windows Defender) to **scan scripts at runtime** (e.g., PowerShell, VBScript).

- It intercepts and scans suspicious code **before** it executes.
    
- Even if code is obfuscated, AMSI can scan the **de-obfuscated form**.
