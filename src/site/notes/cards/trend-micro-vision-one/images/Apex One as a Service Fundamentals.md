### Introduction
---
Trend Micro Apex One as a Service is a cloud-based endpoint protection solution that provides enhanced security against unknown, zero-day, and web-based threats

It also allows analyst/administrator to deploy security policies and deploy updates to every **Security Agent**.
## Adding Administrators
---
An account used to manage Apex One as a Service console:

1. Navigate to the following: ![Apex One as a Service Fundamentals.png](/img/user/cards/trend-micro-vision-one/images/Apex%20One%20as%20a%20Service%20Fundamentals.png)
2. Click **add** button and fill up the required fields then hit **next.**
3. Select role: "Administrator_and_DLP_Comp_Officer" then **save.**

To add a **Active Directory** account (if connected to Apex One), the process is almost the same as doing it in Active Directory itself:
